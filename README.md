# Python Web Scrapping and Web Application Python Shiny

This project involves web scraping using BeautifulSoup on Wikipedia to gather information about the top 50 companies by revenue, utilizing Python. 
Subsequently, we conduct exploratory data analysis, focusing on data cleaning, wrangling, and creating visualizations based on the dataset. 
Finally, we showcase our visualization through a web application created with Shiny Python-Posit and deployed it on shiny.io.
